# Tutorials and information around KEDA and Custom Metrics Autoscaler

There will be an exploration of different tutorials around how to leverage KEDA in OCP

## Overview of this tutorial

In this Repo I want to spend some time covering various KEDA examples.  Some directly tied to OCP others with other tooling.  The Tutorials folder will have the tutorials listed out with some naming that should clue you into what is covered in the tutorial but below in the tutorials section you can see a list of tutorials and names of the tutorial files to review.
